# python-5x5-text-based-battleship

## Why?
In the summer of 2014, I challenged my kids to take a python class on-line 
and code up a text based version of battleship.  They had never coded before 
so they had to learn a lot of concepts.  They did great and this was the 
result of their initial coding experience.

## Why Python?
At the time I was dabbling in Python at work so I figured it would be fun
to get more familiar with Python by helping my kids code something.
